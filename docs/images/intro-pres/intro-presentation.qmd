## Installation
- Quarto is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can download the latest version from <https://quarto.org/download>. 
- However RStudio comes with Quarto pre-installed. So if you have RStudio you don't need to install Quarto separately.

## Getting Started
- To create a quarto document you can use RStudio or any text editor. 
- To create a new quarto document in RStudio go to `File > New File > Quarto...` and select the type of document you want to create. 
- You can also create a new quarto document from the RStudio menu `File > New Project > New Directory > Quarto...`

## How it works
- Quarto documents `(.qmd)` are written in Markdown. 
- Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.
